""" 
ACTOR-CRITIC TRAINER FOR DREAMER AGENT

Alertnates between:
    1. Collecting real env transitions -> storing in replay buffer
    2. Training RewardNetwork and ContinueNetwork on real data from replay buffer
    3. Training ActorNetwork and CriticNetwork on imagined data from world model
    
Inspiration from:
- DreamerV3 (Hafner et al.)
- TWISTER (Burchi & Timofte, ICLR 2025)
