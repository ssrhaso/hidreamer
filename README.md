Trained lightweight CNN Encoder + discrete tokens + attention dynamics = sample-efficient Atari control on a single GPU. Research engineering sprint combining three validated techniques in a novel architecture

- We initially projected DINOv2 embeddings from 384 to 128 dimensions using an MLP, but found this introduced unnecessary information loss. We removed the projection and fed 384-dimensional embeddings directly to the VQ layer, improving codebook utilization from 77/256 to 153/256.

- Frozen DINOv2 embeddings failed on Atari with only 0.08 correlation to game states (paddle position: 0.05, ball position: 0.02-0.15). While temporal consistency (0.53) showed DINOv2 detects motion, it couldn't capture position—the foundation model's natural image features don't transfer to synthetic game graphics. This 10x performance gap vs trainable CNNs (0.8+ correlation) demonstrates when vision foundation models fail: domain shift matters more than model scale. We pivoted to a trained CNN, proving task-specific encoders outperform general-purpose foundations on domain-shifted tasks.
